Chatty App
=====================

A minimal and simple IM chat-room app reminiscent of the OG MSN messenger or IRC.
Currently pretty bare-bones as far as styling goes, standby for some QOL and CSS changes.

### Usage

Clone the repo,install the dependencies and start both the app and the server.
Bear in mind that ./chatty_server/server.js needs to be started independently of the main app.

```
git clone <ssh link> <name for folder>
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
